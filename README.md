# 🩺 Medical Report Simplifier (NLP Project)

## 📌 Overview

Medical reports often contain complex medical terminology that can be difficult for patients to understand.
The **Medical Report Simplifier** is an NLP-based system that extracts text from medical report images and converts complex medical jargon into simple, easy-to-understand explanations.

The system allows a patient to upload a medical report image and receive a simplified explanation of the findings along with general advice.

## 🎯 Objective

* Extract text from medical report images using OCR.
* Identify medical terms and test results.
* Convert complex medical terminology into simplified explanations.
* Provide general health advice based on the extracted information.

---

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. **Upload Medical Report**

   * User uploads an image of a medical report.

2. **Text Extraction (OCR)**

   * Text is extracted using **Tesseract OCR**.

3. **Text Processing**

   * NLP techniques are used to detect medical terms and values.

4. **Medical Term Simplification**

   * Medical jargon is mapped to simple explanations using a predefined dataset/dictionary.

5. **Output**

   * The system generates a simplified explanation of the report.

## 📊 Example Workflow

Input:

* Upload CBC report image

System Processing:

* Extracts text using OCR
* Detects terms like *Hemoglobin*, *WBC*, *Platelets*

Output:

* Simplified explanations such as:

Example:

* **Hemoglobin:** Protein in blood that carries oxygen.
* **Low Hemoglobin:** May indicate anemia.
* **Advice:** Consult a doctor if levels are significantly below normal.

---

## 🔍 Future Improvements

* Support for **PDF medical reports**
* Better **medical entity recognition**
* Integration with **medical knowledge graphs**
* Development of a **web interface for patients**
* Improved accuracy using **larger medical datasets**
